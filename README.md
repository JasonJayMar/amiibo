## Amiibo API

In this project im pulling from a Nintendo API so i can pull characters and show their amiibo or card IMGs
but while doing that I have another API where it guesses if the name sounds like a male or female.
So an example would be if I type in Mario a IMG pops up and a text where it says Male.
